# Unity-2D-Platformer-Workshop
A 2D Platformer from a Unity Workshop for the UNCC Game Design Club <br />
This repo is intended for use with the [UNCC Game Design Workshop](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dBMYh3pcgGIJ3jWSKoY18lTeLbvhqx37xJ-4TU_uXjE/edit?usp=sharing) <br />
I would prefer if you used this as reference during the workshop and only used it as a template after gaining a proper understanding of the code itself. <br />
